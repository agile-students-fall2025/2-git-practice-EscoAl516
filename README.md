[Agile Methodology: Benefits And Challenges For Engineering Leaders](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2023/07/19/agile-methodology-benefits-and-challenges-for-engineering-leaders/)

I find this article compelling because it offers a balanced view of Agile — not just the hype but also what engineering leaders really have to wrestle with. On the one hand, it clearly lays out several strong benefits of Agile such as adaptability, faster feedback loops, and better collaboration among teams. On the other hand, it doesn’t shy away from discussing the challenges: things like cultural resistance, managing expectations, maintaining discipline, and scaling Agile across large teams or organizations. What makes it especially useful is that the article speaks directly to leaders (not just developers), highlighting how adopting Agile is as much about leadership, mindset, and structure as it is about tools and practices. For anyone interested in how to make Agile work in the real world — with messy tradeoffs and people involved — this article gives both lessons and warnings, which is much more practical than just the success stories.
