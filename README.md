# Git Practice Project

## Getting Started With GitHub  
I chose [GitHub’s Hello World tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world) because it walks through the core GitHub workflow: forks, branches, commits, pull requests, and merges. It’s simple, practical, and exactly what beginners need to understand how contributions work. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Why I Found It Helpful  
What I found especially useful is how it breaks down each step into digestible actions — from creating a branch to opening a pull request. This makes the whole process less intimidating when you're new to Git. I also like that it emphasizes collaboration and clean commit history, which are key best practices in software engineering.

By working through this, I’m reinforcing how version control helps teams coordinate, review changes, and maintain a polished project history.
